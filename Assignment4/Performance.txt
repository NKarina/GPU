An error of sorts is displaying the performance at a consistent .14s for all implementations. 
However how it should be shown should generally give the naive implementation to be the slowest.
If the data is small enough, constant memory can outperform shared memory.
However if working with large masks, shared memory will likely perform better.

Large masks will lower the performance due to more calculations needed, and this will be especially true with naive implementation.
Generally, having a larger input array will also slow performance down.
